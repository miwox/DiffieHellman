Bob now sees this sequence of numbers and letters. What could it be? Is it possible that the equals sign at the end is a clue?

Bob had to grin. Alice had told him the necessary P and G, now he just had to find her A. But where could the A be hidden?

His vibrating cell phone snapped him out of his thoughts. A number he didn't know had sent him a message with B? 

Bob must now calculate his B. 
The formula looks like this:
B = g^b mod p and b must be smaller than p
