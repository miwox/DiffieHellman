<div class="storyteller">\
Prime numbers are the building blocks of all integers. Either an integer is itself a prime number or it is composed of prime numbers.\
The number 12, for example, is the product of so-called prime factors, i.e. several prime numbers multiplied together: 2 times 2 times 3.\
 A prime number is divisible only by 1 and by itself.
