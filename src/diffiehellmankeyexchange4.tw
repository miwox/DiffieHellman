Secret Box (that no one can see)<div class="quiz">The common prime number was set to: 7.
The common prime root of modolu 7 was set to: 3.
Alice secret was: 4.
Bobs secret was: 5.
The formula of the computation of the public key is:
{\(Your \: Public \: Key \: = \: g^s \: modulo \: p\)}

The Explanation of the formula:
{\(s\)} is your secret. Very important: {\(s \lt p\)}!
{\(g\)} is the common primitive root of your common primenumber {\(p\)}. Very important: {\(g \lt p\)}. 
{\(p\)} is the common prime number between Alice and Bob.

Under that circumstances:
{\(Bobs \: Public \: Key \: is \: Y&#95;b = \: 3^5 \: modulo \: 7 \: = \: 5 \)}
{\(Alice' \: Public \: Key \: is \: Y&#95;a = \: 3^4 \: modulo \: 7 \: = \: 4 \)}

Step 3:
<div class="storyteller">\
Now it's time to exchange your public keys. Even now it does not matter when someone is now your public keys.
</div>

Step 4: 
<div class="storyteller">\
So both of you received the public key of each other. So in the next step, you'll compute the secret key! Never ever share your secret key with someone. 
And the special thing is that you both will compute the same secret key! Is'nt that wonderful??

<div class="quiz">\
The formular is:
{\(The \: Secret \: Key \: = \: Y^s \: modulo \: p\)}

{\(s\)} is your secret.
{\(Y\)} is the public key of the other person. When you are Alice, {\(Y\)} is public key of Bob.
{\(p\)} is the common prime number between Alice and Bob.
